Troubleshooting the ``esig`` Installation
=========================================
If you find yourself on this page, you may well have been directed to visit by the installer. Here, we detail and provide solutions to a number of commonly occurring problems that you may find when attempting to install and use the ``esig`` package. Compiling and ensuring that ``esig`` works correctly on a wide range of platforms is not trivial -- a lot of work has gone into ensuring it works on the greatest number of systems as possible. However, bad things can happen. Hopefully this page will be able to resolve your problem -- if not, feel free to contact one of the team listed on :ref:`chap-index`.

This should be handled by the installer.
